# **Shiksha Sanjeevani - Admin Panel**

## üìù **Introduction**

**Problem Statement ID**: SIH1661  
**Problem Title**: Implement Software Solutions to Reduce Student Dropout Rates at Various Educational Stages  
**Theme**: Smart Education  
**Team Name**: Innovision Squad  
**Project**: Shiksha Sanjeevani ‚Äì **Admin Panel** for dropout reduction in India

India faces a significant challenge with high student dropout rates, especially in marginalized communities. The **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020** stresses the need for universal education and dropout rate reduction. This admin panel is a core part of **Shiksha Sanjeevani**, providing a comprehensive software solution to analyze and reduce dropout rates, using data-driven approaches.

## üéØ **Objective**

The **Admin Panel** of Shiksha Sanjeevani is designed to empower educational administrators and policymakers by providing in-depth data insights, dropout predictions, and resource allocation tools to reduce dropout rates across various districts, zones, cities, and schools in India.

The solution leverages **AI-powered analytics** and real-time data visualization to identify at-risk students and implement effective interventions, aligning with government schemes like **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao** and **Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan**.
